# DarkKnight
In an NxN board game like a chess, the Dark Knight is a special knight. It moves until it reaches its target. The allowed movements are:
1.	One right and two up.
2.	One right and two down.
3.	One left and two up.
4.	One left and two down.
Itâ€™s desired to calculate the minimum number of moves that allows The Dark Knight to reach its target and kill it.
If the Dark Knight can't reach its target, return -1.
